# Rubrik Postman Collections

[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) is a free application for macOS, Windows, Linux, and Chrome. It is used to explore APIs, build workflows, and share samples with customers and the team. It's especially handy for:

* Building dynamic variables to quickly use the Rubrik API across a multitude of environments.
* Performing a brief demo of one or more API endpoints to showcase functionality.
* Collecting information from a customer site without the need to install or maintain a development platform.

# :hammer: Installation


1. Download the latest collection(s) from `/Collections/CDM/` directory

2. Import the collection JSON(s) that are applicable to your version of Rubrik.

   ```text
   Collation JSONs are named Rubrik -  <RCDM_VERSION> - <API_VERSION> REST API.postman_collection.json

   Where: 
      <CDM_VERSION> is the version of Rubrik Cloud Data Management that the collection was generated from.
      <API_VERSION> is the version of the Rubrik Cloud Data Management API that the collection references.
   ```

   Example: `Rubrik -  v4.2.1-p1 - INTERNAL REST API.postman_collection.json`
   
3. Import the `Rubrik - Sample Environment.postman_environment.json` environment JSON.
